# Jeopardy-Parser

I created this project for a friend of mine who was a contestant in the Jeopardy Tournament of Champions. The project uses a database of over 4700 Jeopardy! games in a .csv file, cleans the data for each game, organizes it, and outputs the data of every question as you might see it on the game show, Jeopardy!. It prompts the user for his answer and keeps track of his score.
